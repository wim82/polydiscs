# \<polydiscs\>

Browse your discogs collection - as an experiment in exploring polymer 2

## Discogs Authentication
For now I use my personal authentication token. It is hidden in a non commited config.js file. Just place your discogs token in a const in a config.js file in the root of the project.

## Testing
I run tests using polymer test -l chrome. Chrome compatibility is sufficient for now.
